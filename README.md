# Sentiment Analysis for Kannada Language

This project focuses on sentiment analysis for the Kannada language. The main goal is to classify input Kannada sentences into different emotions such as sad, happy, fear, and angry. Sentiment analysis is a subfield of natural language processing that involves determining the sentiment or emotion expressed in a given piece of text.

## Features

- Input: Kannada sentences
- Output: Predicted emotions (sad, happy, fear, angry)

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: Gather a dataset of Kannada sentences labeled with emotions (e.g., sad, happy, fear, angry).

2. **Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the text data, including tasks like tokenization, removing stop words, and stemming.

3. **Model Training**: Train a sentiment analysis model using machine learning or deep learning techniques. Popular approaches include using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or transformer models.

4. **Inference**: Deploy the trained model to make predictions on new Kannada sentences.

5. **Visualization**: Visualize the predicted emotions using graphs or charts to provide insights into the sentiment distribution.
